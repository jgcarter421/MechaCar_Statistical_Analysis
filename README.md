**Statistical Summary of Using Linear Regression to Predict Fuel Efficiency**

1. The **Vehicle Lenght** and **Ground Clearance** variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.  On the other hand, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD (also known as All Wheel Drive) each indicate a random amount of variance to the dataset.

2. With a normal significance level of 0.5, and our P-Value much smaller than that, there suggests significant evidence to reject our null hypothesis.  This indicates that the slope of our line is not 0.

3. This linear regression model has an R-squared value of 0.7149, meaning that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model.  This linear model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
